Acid Cam is a application that turns your webcam/video files into a work of Art.
Contains a lot of filters, and you can combine them with the custom filter option.
It also supports plugins (write your own filters in C++). This project was created
in hopes of providing some entertainment, or for the Glitch artist  to give you a 
starting image/video to use with other tools. There are also versions of this program
for other platforms specifically Linux/Windows. 

This project contains the compiled static libraries / include files required to build the program.
The project is for Xcode 8.2
