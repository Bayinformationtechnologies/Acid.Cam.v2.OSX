# Acid.Cam.v2.OSX

Acid Cam is a application that turns your webcam/video files into a work of Art.

This requires the OpenCV 2.x header files
the project is configured for them to be in /opt/local/include
but you can change that in Header Search Paths in the Build Settings in Xcode.
This project contains the compiled static libraries required to create the program.
