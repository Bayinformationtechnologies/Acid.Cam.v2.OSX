Watch a video tutorial on how to create plugins: https://youtu.be/hOnBUJIdAyU

To Create a plugin all you need is two externed C functions

#include<iostream>

// the pixel function is called every pixel that 
// needs to be updated for the filter
// this is where you manipulate the color
// information to produce the effect your trying
// to create
// the x and y variables are the location of the pixel
// the pix array is the three RGB values for the pixels color information
extern "C" void pixel(int x, int y, unsigned char *pix);

// drawn is called after every iteration through the frame
// so after each pixel is updated drawn is called
extern "C" void drawn();


// example 

static float alpha = 1.0f; // set alpha variable for function

// pixel function
void pixel(int x, int y, unsigned char *pix) {
	// sets the three RGB color variables
        pix[0] = pix[0]*alpha;
        pix[1] = pix[1]*alpha;
        pix[2] = pix[2]*alpha;
}

// called after the image is drawn update the alpha variable
void drawn() {
        alpha += 0.01f;
}

// to compile the filter use the following commands
// if your source file is called filter.cpp

 g++ -shared filter.cpp -o filter.dylib

Use plug-load to debug/test that your plugin executes.
Use it like this:

./plug-debug plugin.dylib 10

plugin.dylib being the plugin and 10 being the number of frames to test it with.
